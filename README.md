# Visualising Ukkonen's algorithm

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
This is a project inspired by Brenden's excellent website with the same goal (see <a href = https://brenden.github.io/ukkonen-animation/>https://brenden.github.io/ukkonen-animation/</a>). The scope of this project is improve upon and address certain limitations of the aformentioned tool, also providing a different outlook.

<h2>Motive</h2>
There are many reasons behind the creation of this tool, from more practical reasons to simply for educational purposes, of course any programming tends to be instructive regardless of whether it is a reinvention. The main reasons behind this website are to:
<br></br>
<ul>
  <li>Allow for indefinately sized strings</li>
  <li>Provide control over the display of the tree</li>
  <li>Correctly display suffix links</li>
</ul>

The second motivation for this website is to provide source code for an efficient implementation of this algorithm.

<h2>The algorithm</h2>
Ukkonen's algorithm is a O(n) time complexity algorithm for building a suffix tree. 
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
Many thanks to:
<ul>
  <li>Visjs (<a href = "https://visjs.org/">https://visjs.org/</a>)</li>
  For providing the functionality used to render the graph.
  <li>Collectionsjs (<a href = "https://www.collectionsjs.com/">https://www.collectionsjs.com/</a></li>)
  For its deque data structure.
</ul>
